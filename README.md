# Surfs Up 

## Overview

Provide analysis of temperature trends for the months of June and December in the Hawaiian island of O'ahu to gauge the potential year-round sustainability of a surf and ice cream shop.

> **Resources:** ***SQLite, hawaii.sqlite, SQLAlchemy, Jupyter Notebbok, Pandas, Python3***

## Results

* With 1700 measurements, the average temperature during June is nearly 75°F (74.9) and 71°F for December with 1517 measurements.
* There is a 27° range for December (Highest 83°F vs Lowest 56°F) and a 21° range for June (Highest 85°F vs Lowest 64°F)
* Majority of the temperatures are above 70°F given Lower Quartile of 69°F for December and 73°F for June.

## Summary

With averages in the low to mid 70's year-round and standard deviations of a little over ±3°, it is safe to say that a surf and ice cream shop   

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Two additional queries would be a further analysis by station to see where on the island may be an optimal location and an overal statistical summary of precipitation and then by station for the same reason.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Also, even though the data isn't present on the file and given Hawaii being in the middle of the ring of fire, wind speeds and tsunami trend data can be extremely helpful. And given that O'ahu is where the state capital is located, peak tourism data may further inform this analysis.
